# My Vim files

On Unix this repository should be saved as `~/.vim/`.
On Windows this repository should be saved as `~/vimfiles/`.

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for managing external plugins.
They will be stored in a `plugged/` folder after you open Vim and run `:Plug install`.

## TODO

Make sure vimrc runs without errors even when no plugins are loaded.
